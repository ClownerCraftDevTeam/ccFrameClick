# ccFrameClick
Spigot Plugin to allow commands to be run when a player clicks an item frame. Works well combined with custom maps.
All commands are run as the player that clicked, and all the messages are customisable in messages.yml

Commands:
---------

- `/ccframe reload` - Reload the plugin Config and Messages files.
- `/ccframe set <command without />` - add a frame command
- `/ccframe remove`  - remove a frame command

Permissions:
------------

- `ccframeclick.admin` - use the admin set/remove/reload command
- `ccframeclick.click` - allow a user to use the frame commands
